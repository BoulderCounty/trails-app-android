Boulder County Trails App Android
========================

What is it?
-----------

The Boulder County Trails App provides a map and listing of many trails that Boulder County manages. The app shows 

-Trail Length
-Trail Difficulty
-Parking Locations
-Allowed Uses (dogs, bikes and horses)
-Locate Me (see where you are on the trail)

A working version of the app can be downloaded at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bouldercounty.parks.trails 


How It Works
------------------

The app pulls data from the local KML file (/res/raw/new_7_24_2012.kml) so trail information can be displayed on the device even when the device is not connected to the internet.  


Warnings
-----------

This app was written for Google Maps Android API v1. In order for the app to work going forward, it will need to be rewritten for v2.
